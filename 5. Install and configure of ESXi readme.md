# Getting Started with ESXi on VMware Workstation Player üöÄ

## Powering Up and Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

1.  Start the VMware Workstation Player application.
2.  Power on the virtual machine that has the ESXi image attached.
3.  Follow the on-screen installation wizard. This typically involves:
    * Accepting the End User License Agreement (EULA).
    * Selecting the virtual disk where ESXi will be installed.

## Configuration Settings üõ†Ô∏è

1.  Set a strong and secure root password when prompted. This password will be used for administrative access to the ESXi host.
2.  Configure the management network settings. This is crucial for accessing and managing your ESXi host. You may need to:
    * Assign a static IP address for reliable access.
    * Set a hostname to easily identify your ESXi host on the network.

## Completion ‚úÖ

1.  After the installation and initial configuration are complete, the ESXi server will automatically reboot.
2.  Going forward, you will manage this ESXi server remotely using the vSphere Client or a web browser by connecting to the IP address or hostname you configured.
