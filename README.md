# Creating a Home Lab with VMware

🧠 Learning Hub: Virtualization & VMware JourneyWelcome to my learning repository, where I document my journey through the world of virtualization technologies, with a special focus on VMware solutions. This space serves as both a study log and a hands-on portfolio as I dive deeper into mastering system administration within virtual environments.
🎯 Learning Objectives1. 🌀 Understanding VirtualizationLearn what virtualization is and why it's a critical foundation for modern IT infrastructure.
Explore different types of virtualization including hardware, software, desktop, and storage virtualization.
Break down the core concepts: hypervisors, virtual machines (VMs), snapshots, templates, and resource allocation.
Evaluate the benefits and limitations of virtualization in real-world IT environments.
2. 🛠️ VMware Products OverviewGain a comprehensive overview of the VMware ecosystem.
Understand the role of key VMware products such as:
VMware ESXi – bare-metal hypervisor
vCenter Server – centralized management platform
VMware Workstation/Player – local VM environments
VMware vSphere – cloud computing virtualization platform
Identify use cases and deployment strategies for each product.
3. 🧪 Practical Hands-On SkillsBuild a fully functional VMware lab using physical or virtual hardware.
Install and configure VMware ESXi from scratch.
Create and manage virtual machines (VMs), exploring features like cloning, snapshots, and VM migrations.
Understand different types of hypervisors and how they interact with hardware and guest OSes.
Troubleshoot common issues and optimize performance in a virtualized environment.
4. 🖥️ System Administration in a Virtual WorldDevelop essential system administration skills for managing virtual infrastructure.
Learn how virtualization impacts day-to-day tasks for IT support and infrastructure teams.
Dive into networking and storage configuration, user management, patching, and resource monitoring in VMware environments.
Prepare for real-world scenarios where virtualization plays a pivotal role in business continuity and scaling IT services.
