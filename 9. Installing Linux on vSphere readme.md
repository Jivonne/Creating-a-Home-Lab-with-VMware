# Setting Up CentOS on vSphere

This guide outlines the steps to set up a CentOS virtual machine within a vSphere environment.

## üíæ Downloading the CentOS ISO Image

1.  Navigate to the official CentOS downloads page.
2.  Locate the appropriate ISO image for your desired CentOS version (e.g., CentOS Stream, CentOS Linux).
3.  Download the DVD ISO image.

## üì§ Uploading the ISO Image to vSphere

1.  Connect to your vSphere Client.
2.  Browse to your Datastore.
3.  Create a new directory (optional, but recommended) for ISO images.
4.  Use the Datastore browser to upload the downloaded CentOS ISO image to the newly created directory or an existing ISO storage location.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Attaching the ISO Image to the Virtual Machine

1.  Select the target virtual machine in your vSphere inventory.
2.  Right-click on the VM and select **Edit Settings**.
3.  Go to the **Hardware** tab.
4.  Click **Add New Device** and select **CD/DVD Drive**. Click **Add**.
5.  In the new CD/DVD Drive settings:
    * Select **Datastore ISO File**.
    * Click **Browse...** and locate the uploaded CentOS ISO image in your Datastore.
    * Ensure the **Connect at power on** checkbox is selected.
6.  Go to the **VM Options** tab.
7.  Expand **Boot Options**.
8.  Check the **Force BIOS Setup** checkbox. This will ensure the VM boots into the BIOS setup on the next power-on.
9.  Click **OK** to save the VM settings.

## üöÄ Installing the OS

1.  Power on the virtual machine. It should boot directly into the BIOS setup due to the "Force BIOS Setup" option.
2.  Navigate to the **Boot** tab in the BIOS.
3.  Ensure that the CD-ROM drive is listed before the Hard Drive in the boot order. If not, use the appropriate keys (usually `+` and `-` or `Page Up` and `Page Down`) to move the CD-ROM drive to the top.
4.  Save the changes and exit the BIOS. The VM will reboot and should now boot from the CentOS ISO image.
5.  The CentOS installation menu will appear. Select **Install CentOS Linux** and press Enter.
6.  Follow the on-screen instructions to proceed with the installation:
    * **Language Selection:** Choose your preferred language.
    * **Installation Source:** Verify that the installation source is the local media (your attached ISO).
    * **Software Selection:** Choose the base environment and any additional software you need. For a server, the "Server with GUI" or "Minimal Install" options are common.
    * **Installation Destination:** Configure your virtual disk. You might choose automatic partitioning or configure custom partitioning.
    * **Network & Host Name:** Configure your network settings and set the hostname for your server.
    * **Time & Date:** Select your time zone.
    * **Root Password:** Set a strong password for the root user. **Remember this password!**
    * **User Creation:** Create at least one regular user account. You will need to provide a username and a password for this user.
7.  Once all settings are configured, click **Begin Installation**.
8.  The installation process will take some time. Once it's complete, click **Reboot**.
9.  After the reboot, the CentOS system will start. You can log in using the root user and the password you set or with the regular user account you created.

Congratulations! You have successfully installed CentOS on your vSphere virtual machine.
