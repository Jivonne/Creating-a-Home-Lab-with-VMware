# SSH Access to ESXi Server

This document outlines how to access your ESXi server using SSH.

## <ins>Why SSH?</ins> üíª

ESXi runs on a modified Linux kernel, and Secure Shell (SSH) provides a secure way to connect to the server's command-line interface. This allows for advanced management and troubleshooting.

## <ins>Prerequisites</ins>

You will need an SSH client installed on your local machine. Popular options include:

* **PuTTY:** A free SSH and Telnet client for Windows.
* **SecureCRT:** A commercial SSH client for various operating systems.

## <ins>Enabling SSH on ESXi</ins> ‚öôÔ∏è

For security reasons, SSH is disabled by default. You can enable it through one of the following methods:

### 1. vSphere Web Client

1.  Connect to your vSphere web client.
2.  Navigate to the host.
3.  Go to **Configure** > **Services** > **SSH**.
4.  Click **Edit** and change the **Startup Policy** to "Start and stop with host" or "Start automatically".
5.  Click **Start** to enable the service immediately.

### 2. ESXi Direct Console User Interface (DCUI)

1.  Connect to the ESXi console directly (e.g., via a physical terminal or remote console).
2.  Press **F2** to customize the system.
3.  Log in with your root credentials.
4.  Navigate to **Troubleshooting Options**.
5.  Select **Enable SSH** and press **Enter**.

## <ins>Connecting via SSH</ins> üîë

Once SSH is enabled:

1.  Open your SSH client (e.g., PuTTY or SecureCRT).
2.  Enter the IP address or hostname of your ESXi server in the "Host Name (or IP address)" field.
3.  Ensure the port is set to **22** (the default SSH port).
4.  Select **SSH** as the connection type.
5.  Click **Open** or **Connect**.
6.  You will be prompted to enter your ESXi root username and password.

## <ins>Using the SSH Connection</ins> üõ†Ô∏è

After successfully connecting, you will have a command-line interface to your ESXi server. You can use standard Linux commands for navigation and basic operations:

* `pwd`: Displays the current working directory.
* `ls`: Lists the files and directories in the current directory.

For ESXi-specific management tasks, you can use the `esxcli` command. For example:

* `esxcli vm process list`: Lists the running virtual machines.
* `esxcli network vswitch list`: Lists the virtual switches.

**Remember to disable SSH when it is no longer needed to enhance the security of your ESXi host.**
