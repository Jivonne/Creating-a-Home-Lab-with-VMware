 # What is Virtulization
 
- **Definition**: Virtualization refers to creating a virtual version of something, such as a computer, that is not physically present but can perform real tasks.
- **Physical vs. Virtual Computers**: Physical computers have hardware resources like RAM and CPUs. Virtualization allows multiple operating systems and applications to run on a single physical machine, optimizing resource usage.
- Resource Utilization: Virtualization helps fully utilize the hardware resources of a physical server by running multiple operating systems and applications simultaneously, unlike dual-boot systems which can only run one OS at a time.

# Types Of Virtualization

- Hardware Virtualization: Creates virtual machines that behave like physical computers, allowing multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine. Includes full virtualization (isolated VMs) and paravirtualization (cooperative VMs).
- Operating System Virtualization (Containerization): Creates isolated user space environments within a single OS kernel, allowing multiple applications to run in isolated environments without needing separate operating systems. Example: Docker.
- Network Virtualization: Combines network resources by splitting bandwidth into independent channels, creating virtual networks within physical networks. Example: Software Defined Networking (SDN).
- Storage Virtualization: Abstracts physical storage devices to appear as a single storage pool, enabling easier management and scaling. Example: Storage Area Network (SAN).
- Desktop Virtualization: Provides users access to a virtual desktop environment. Example: Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI).
- Application Virtualization: Allows applications to run on a host system without being installed on it, creating a virtual environment for applications. Example: VMware ThinApp.
- Data Virtualization: Allows users to retrieve and manipulate data without needing details of its format or physical location, integrating data from various sources to create a unified view. Example: Denodo.
