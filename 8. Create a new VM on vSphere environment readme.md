# Creating a Virtual Machine on ESXi üöÄ

This guide outlines the steps to create a new virtual machine on your ESXi server.

## Preparation ‚öôÔ∏è

* **ESXi Server:** Ensure your ESXi server is powered on and accessible through a web browser. You'll need the IP address or hostname to connect.

## Creating the VM üñ•Ô∏è

1.  **Connect to vSphere:** Open your web browser and navigate to the vSphere Client (usually `https://your_esxi_ip_or_hostname/ui`). Log in with your ESXi administrator credentials.

2.  **Navigate to Hosts and Clusters:** In the vSphere Client inventory, click on **Hosts and Clusters**.

3.  **Select a Host:** Choose the ESXi host where you want to create the new virtual machine.

4.  **Create a New Virtual Machine:** Right-click on the selected host (or a cluster/resource pool within the host) and select **New Virtual Machine...**.

5.  **Select Creation Type:** Choose **Create a new virtual machine** and click **Next**.

6.  **Name and Location:**
    * **Virtual machine name:** Enter a descriptive name for your new VM (e.g., `centos-web-server`).
    * **Location:** Select the datacenter or folder where you want to store the VM. Click **Next**.

7.  **Select a Compute Resource:** Choose the ESXi host or cluster where the VM will run. Click **Next**.

8.  **Select Storage:** Select the datastore where the VM's files will be stored. Click **Next**.

9.  **Select Compatibility:** Choose the ESXi hardware compatibility level. It's generally recommended to select the latest compatible version for your environment. Click **Next**.

10. **Select Guest OS Family and Version:**
    * **Guest OS Family:** Choose the operating system family you plan to install (e.g., **Linux**).
    * **Guest OS Version:** Select the specific version of the operating system (e.g., **CentOS 8 (64-bit)**). Click **Next**.

11. **Configure Virtual Hardware:**
    * **CPUs:** Specify the number of virtual CPUs to allocate to the VM.
    * **Memory:** Enter the amount of RAM (in MB or GB) to allocate.
    * **Hard disk(s):**
        * Click **Add new hard disk**.
        * Specify the size of the virtual disk.
        * Choose the disk provisioning type (e.g., Thin Provision, Thick Provision Lazy Zeroed, Thick Provision Eager Zeroed). Thin provisioning saves space initially.
        * Select the virtual device node (usually SCSI controller 0, LUN 0).
    * **Network adapter:** Ensure a network adapter is present and connected to an appropriate virtual network.
    * **(Optional) CD/DVD Drive:** If you plan to install the OS from an ISO file, select **Datastore ISO File** and browse to the ISO image. Alternatively, you can choose **Client Device** if you have a physical installation media connected to your local machine.

12. **Review and Finish:** Review the configuration summary. If everything looks correct, click **Finish**.

## Final Steps ‚úÖ

* The virtual machine will now be created and listed in your vSphere inventory.
* **Important:** The VM is currently empty. You will need to power on the virtual machine and install the operating system you selected during the creation process. This typically involves booting from an installation ISO or media.
