 # What is Virtualization
 
- **Definition**: Virtualization refers to creating a virtual version of something, such as a computer, that is not physically present but can perform real tasks.
- **Physical vs. Virtual Computers**: Physical computers have hardware resources like RAM and CPUs. Virtualization allows multiple operating systems and applications to run on a single physical machine, optimizing resource usage.
- **Resource Utilization**: Virtualization helps fully utilize the hardware resources of a physical server by running multiple operating systems and applications simultaneously, unlike dual-boot systems which can only run one OS at a time.

# 🔍 Virtualization Types Overview

## 🖥️ Hardware Virtualization
- Creates virtual machines (VMs) that behave like physical computers.
- Allows multiple operating systems to run on a single physical machine.
- Types:
  - **Full Virtualization**: Provides completely isolated VMs.
  - **Paravirtualization**: VMs are aware of each other and cooperate for better performance.

## 🐳 Operating System Virtualization (Containerization)
- Creates isolated user space environments within a single OS kernel.
- Enables running multiple applications in separate containers without needing full OS installations.
- **Example**: Docker

## 🌐 Network Virtualization
- Combines and manages network resources by splitting bandwidth into independent channels.
- Creates virtual networks within physical networks.
- **Example**: Software Defined Networking (SDN)

## 💾 Storage Virtualization
- Abstracts multiple physical storage devices into a single, unified storage pool.
- Simplifies management and enables scalable storage solutions.
- **Example**: Storage Area Network (SAN)

## 🧑‍💻 Desktop Virtualization
- Provides users access to a virtual desktop environment, often from remote locations.
- Enables centralized management of desktop environments.
- **Example**: Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI)

## 📦 Application Virtualization
- Runs applications in a virtual environment on a host system without traditional installation.
- Ensures isolation from the underlying OS.
- **Example**: VMware ThinApp

## 🗂️ Data Virtualization
- Integrates and presents data from various sources as a unified view.
- Allows access to data without concern for its physical format or location.
- **Example**: Denodo
